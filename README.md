# VarQFS

Reproduction of the paper *Variational quantum algorithm for unconstrained black box binary optimization: Application to feature selection* by Christa Zoufal et al., 2022.

A first version uses SPSA optimizer and provide results. 

The second is an approach with QNSPSA but faces some issues.
